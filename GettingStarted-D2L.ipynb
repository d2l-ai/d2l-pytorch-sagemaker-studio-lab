    "[Dive into Deep Learning (D2L)](https://www.d2l.ai/) is an open source, interactive book that teaches the ideas, the mathematical theory, and the code that powers deep learning. With over 150 Jupyter notebooks, D2L provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning principles and a state-of-the-art introduction to deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing. With tens of millions of online page views, D2L has been adopted for teaching by over 250 universities from 50 countries (e.g., Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and University of Cambridge). \n",
