    "\n",
    "Dive into Deep Learning (D2L, [d2l.ai](https://www.d2l.ai/)) is an interactive deep learning book with code, math, and discussions. Over 200 universities, including more than half of Top 30 universities (e.g., Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, Tsinghua University) adopt D2L as course or supplemental material. \n",

    "we quickly bring you up to speed \n",
    "on the prerequisites required\n",
    "for hands-on deep learning, \n",
