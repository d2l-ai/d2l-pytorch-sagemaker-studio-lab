    "*Dive into Deep Learning (D2L)* is an open source, interactive book that teaches the ideas, the mathematical theory, and the code that powers machine learning. With over 150 Jupyter notebooks, D2L provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning principles and a state-of-the-art introduction to deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing. \n",

    "There are just two steps to start your deep learning journey!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Start Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose `CPU` or `GPU` and click `Start instance`.\n",
    "First-time users without GPU experience\n",
    "are recommended to start with `CPU`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Copy to Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Click `Copy to project`.\n",
    "First-time users\n",
    "are recommended to select \"Clone Entire Repo\"\n",
    "and keep all the prompts as default \n",
    "when cloning the Git repository.\n",

    "## Learning by Doing\n",
    "\n",
    "D2L represents our attempt to make deep learning approachable, teaching you the concepts, the context, and the code. The entire book is drafted in Jupyter notebooks, seamlessly integrating exposition figures, math, and interactive examples with self-contained code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to offer a resource that could\n",
    "1. be freely available for everyone;\n",
    "1. offer sufficient technical depth to provide a starting point on the path to actually becoming an applied machine learning scientist;\n",
    "1. include runnable code, showing readers how to solve problems in practice;\n",
    "1. allow for rapid updates, both by us and also by the community at large.\n",
