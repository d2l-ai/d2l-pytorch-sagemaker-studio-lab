    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is for students (undergraduate or graduate),\n",
    "engineers, and researchers, who seek a solid grasp\n",
    "of the practical techniques of deep learning.\n",
    "Because we explain every concept from scratch,\n",
    "no previous background in deep learning or machine learning is required.\n",
    "Fully explaining the methods of deep learning\n",
    "requires some mathematics and programming,\n",
    "but we will only assume that you come in with some basics,\n",
    "including modest amounts of linear algebra, \n",
    "calculus, probability, and Python programming.\n",
    "Just in case you forget the basics,\n",
    "the Appendix chapter *Mathematics for Deep Learning*\n",
    "provides a refresher \n",
    "on most of the mathematics \n",
    "you will find in this book.\n",

    "## Content and Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This book can be roughly divided into three parts \n",
