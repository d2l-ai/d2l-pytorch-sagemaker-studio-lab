    "\n",
    "[Dive into Deep Learning (D2L)](https://www.d2l.ai/) is an open source, interactive book drafted in Jupyter notebooks, seamlessly integrating exposition figures, math, and interactive examples with self-contained code. With tens of millions of online page views, D2L has been adopted for teaching by over 250 universities from 50 countries (e.g., Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and University of Cambridge). \n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is for students (undergraduate or graduate),\n",
    "engineers, and researchers, who seek a solid grasp\n",
    "of the practical techniques of deep learning.\n",
    "Because we explain every concept from scratch,\n",
    "no previous background in deep learning or machine learning is required.\n",
    "Fully explaining the methods of deep learning\n",
    "requires some mathematics and programming,\n",
    "but we will only assume that you come in with some basics,\n",
    "including modest amounts of linear algebra, \n",
    "calculus, probability, and Python programming.\n",
    "Just in case you forget the basics,\n",
    "the Appendix chapter *Mathematics for Deep Learning*\n",
    "provides a refresher \n",
    "on most of the mathematics \n",
    "you will find in this book.\n",
    "Most of the time, we will prioritize \n",
    "intuition and ideas\n",
    "over mathematical rigor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content and Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This book can be roughly divided into three parts \n",
    "(corresponding to three different colors):\n",
    "preliminaries, deep learning techniques,\n",
    "and advanced topics with real world applications (as shown in the figure below).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Book structure](https://d2l.ai/_images/book-org.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first part (chapter 1-4) covers basics and preliminaries.\n",
    "Chapter *1. Introduction* offers \n",
    "an overview of deep learning.\n",
    "Next, Chapter *2. Preliminaries* \n",
    "teaches the prerequisites required\n",
    "for hands-on deep learning, \n",
    "such as how to store and manipulate data,\n",
    "and how to apply various numerical operations \n",
    "based on basic concepts from linear algebra, \n",
    "calculus, and probability.\n",
    "Then, Chapter *3. Linear Neural Networks* and \n",
    "Chapter *4. Multilayer Perceptrons* \n",
    "cover the most basic concepts \n",
    "and techniques in deep learning,\n",
    "including regression and classification;\n",
    "linear models and multilayer perceptrons;\n",
    "and overfitting and regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The next six chapters focus on modern deep learning techniques.\n",
    "Chapter *5. Deep Learning Computation* describes \n",
    "the key computational components \n",
    "of deep learning systems\n",
    "and lays the groundwork\n",
    "for our subsequent implementations\n",
    "of more complex models.\n",
    "Next, Chapter *6. Convolutional Neural Networks* and \n",
    "Chapter *7. Modern Convolutional Neural Networks* \n",
    "demonstrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), \n",
    "powerful tools that form the backbone \n",
    "of most modern computer vision (CV) systems.\n",
    "Similarly, Chapter *8. Recurrent Neural Networks*  and \n",
    "Chapter *9. Modern Recurrent Neural Networks* \n",
    "illustrate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), \n",
    "models that exploit sequential (e.g., temporal) \n",
    "structure in data and are commonly used\n",
    "for natural language processing (NLP) \n",
    "and time series prediction.\n",
    "In Chapter *10. Attention Mechanisms*, \n",
    "we introduce a relatively new class of models\n",
    "based on attention and transformer mechanisms, \n",
    "which is the dominant architecture\n",
    "for most NLP tasks.\n",
    "These chapters will bring you up to speed \n",
    "on the most powerful and general tools\n",
    "that are widely used by deep learning practitioners.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Part three discusses scalability, efficiency, and applications.\n",
    "First, in Chapter *11. Optimization Algorithms*,\n",
    "we discuss common optimization methods\n",
    "used to train deep learning models.\n",
    "The next Chapter *12. Computational Performance* \n",
    "examines several key factors\n",
    "that influence the computational performance \n",
    "of your deep learning code.\n",
    "In Chapter *13. Computer Vision*,\n",
    "we illustrate major applications \n",
    "of deep learning in CV.\n",
    "In Chapter *14. Natural Language Processing: Pretraining* \n",
    "and Chapter *15. Natural Language Processing: Applications*,\n",
