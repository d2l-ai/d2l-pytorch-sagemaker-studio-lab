    "If didn't see the `d2l` environment in your existing kernels (by clicking `Change kernel`), you can setup the environment now: simply click on <button data-commandlinker-command=\"conda env create -f env.yml\" data-commandlinker-args=\"{&quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en&quot;}\">Install D2L Environmnet</button>\n",
    ", and you will create a new environment named `d2l` with all the required Python packages (as listed in `env.yml`). The `d2l` environment will be used by all the jupyter notebooks automatically.\n",

    "## About D2L\n",
    "\n",
    "Dive into Deep Learning ([d2l.ai](https://www.d2l.ai/)) is an interactive deep learning book with code, math, and discussions. Over 200 universities, including more than half of the top 30 universities (e.g., Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, Tsinghua University) adopt D2L as a course or supplemental material. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is for students (undergraduate or graduate),\n",
    "engineers, and researchers, who seek a solid grasp\n",
    "of the practical techniques of deep learning.\n",
    "Because we explain every concept from scratch,\n",
    "no previous background in deep learning or machine learning is required.\n",
    "Fully explaining the methods of deep learning\n",
    "requires some mathematics and programming,\n",
    "but we will only assume that you come in with some basics,\n",
    "including modest amounts of linear algebra, \n",
    "calculus, probability, and Python programming.\n",
    "Just in case you forget the basics,\n",
    "the Appendix chapter *Mathematics for Deep Learning*\n",
    "provides a refresher \n",
    "on most of the mathematics \n",
    "you will find in this book.\n",
    "Most of the time, we will prioritize \n",
    "intuition and ideas\n",
    "over mathematical rigor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content and Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "As showing in the image below, \n",
    "D2L book can be roughly divided into three parts \n",

    "![Book structure](https://d2l.ai/_images/book-org.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first part (chapter 1-4) covers basics and preliminaries.\n",
    "Chapter *1. Introduction* offers \n",

    "teaches the prerequisites required\n",
    "for hands-on deep learning, \n",
    "such as how to store and manipulate data,\n",
    "and how to apply various numerical operations \n",
    "based on basic concepts from linear algebra, \n",
    "calculus, and probability.\n",
    "Then, chapter *3. Linear Neural Networks* and \n",
    "chapter *4. Multilayer Perceptrons* \n",
    "cover the most basic concepts \n",
    "and techniques in deep learning,\n",
    "including regression and classification;\n",
    "linear models and multilayer perceptrons;\n",
    "and overfitting and regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The next five chapters focus on modern deep learning techniques.\n",
    "Chapter *5. Deep Learning Computation* describes \n",
    "the key computational components \n",
    "of deep learning systems\n",
    "and lays the groundwork\n",

    "of more complex models.\n",
    "Next, chapter *6. Convolutional Neural Networks* and \n",
    "chapter *7. Modern Convolutional Neural Networks* \n",
    "demonstrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), \n",

    "Similarly, chapter *8. Recurrent Neural Networks*  and \n",
    "chapter *9. Modern Recurrent Neural Networks* \n",
    "illustrate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), \n",
    "models that exploit sequential (e.g., temporal) \n",
    "structure in data and are commonly used\n",
    "for natural language processing (NLP) \n",
    "and time series prediction.\n",
    "In chapter *10. Attention Mechanisms*, \n",
    "we introduce a relatively new class of models\n",
    "based on attention and transformer mechanisms, \n",
    "which is the dominant architecture\n",
    "for most NLP tasks.\n",
    "These sections will bring you up to speed \n",
    "on the most powerful and general tools\n",
    "that are widely used by deep learning practitioners.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Part three discusses scalability, efficiency, and applications.\n",
    "First, in chapter *11. Optimization Algorithms*,\n",
    "we discuss common optimization methods\n",
    "used to train deep learning models.\n",
    "The next chapter *12. Computational Performance* \n",
    "examines several key factors\n",
    "that influence the computational performance \n",
    "of your deep learning code.\n",
    "In chapter *13. Computer Vision*,\n",
    "we illustrate major applications \n",
    "of deep learning in CV.\n",
    "In chapter *14. Natural Language Processing: Pretraining* \n",
    "and chapter *15. Natural Language Processing: Applications*,\n",
